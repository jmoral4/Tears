//  Tears.Engine is a TBS similar to civ/or any tbs, in space
Conceptual
	
Dynamic
	//all entities which implement I moveable
Static	
	//all static entities (don't move around)

Base->
	Id
	Name
	Description
	Location -> cell x/y

Renderable
	Rect
	Texture

Moveable
	speed //in tiles
	range	
	vector //where is it headed

Something can be Renderable and Collidable
Something can be Renderable and not collidable
Everything on screen needs a location rectangle
All renderables need textures and color information
Conceptual Entities do not need location nor collidable nor texture information
Conceptuals should derive from something else entirely...

Example
	Capital Ship->Renderable, Moveable, Collidable, IShip, BaseEntity
	Planet -> Renderable, Collidable, IPlanet, BaseEntity
	Asteroid -> Renderable, collidable, moveable, IAnomaly, BaseEntity
	// keep conceptual entities entirely out of this object structure
