In the spirit of Get-Shit-Done (GSD) --  the file format will be in an easily modifiable CSV.

https://github.com/JoshClose/CsvHelper

This library allows for fast read/write and serialization to .net classes. Keeping the types simple for the serializer will make things easier.

It will be 1 file per 'class' and each column corresponds to a simple field type

Actors: //everything required to load an actor and set their texture
[NAME], [TYPE], [TEXTURE NAME], [SCALE], [COLOR], [SPEED], [HP], [STAT1], [STAT2], [STAT3]

LevelData:  //everything required to setup and load a level
[LEVEL_NAME], [LEVEL_TEXTURE_NAME], [COLLISION_TEXTURE_NAME], [ACTORS_FILE_NAME]

1. The engine will Read in the Level Data
2. The engine will Read in the Level Texture
3. The engine will Read in the collision data
4. The engine will Read in the ACTOR templates
5. Based on the ACTOR templates, the engine will load the required textures into the TextureManager
6. The engine will create Actors from the ACTOR templates as needed
