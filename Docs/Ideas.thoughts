Utilize player familiarity with QWER + DF  in DOTA/LOL/SMITE
  Utilizes mouse movement (click to move) (click hold to move?)

This requires a fundamentally different approach to movement, colission, and combat ...


Original concept was similar to SEGA Shadowrun 
   Button 1 Cycle Targets, Button 2 Fire Current, Scroll switch Characters
   Move with WASD/ARROWS 
   On GamePad (X / A / B ) + Arrows
   
What _I_ like as a gamer in 2D indie top-downs:
     Characters
     Items
     Diverse Maps
     Diverse Enemies
     Long Gameplay
     Scaling, Challenging Gameplay
  
Tears concept where it's DF or Digital Reset or SCZ.. should include the following
     Characters
     Mutiplayer (at least 2)
     Unique Items
     Randomly generated 'path'
     
Ideas:
     Utilizing the SGSR targetting system we can have both click attacks on targets and lock-on attacks on other targets.
     For instance, slash sword with click, lock and fire with other click, move with WASD?
     Click-to-move is incompatible with console controller but more compatible with tablets/phones
     Can also do Click-to-move but also have Q as acquire target and E as fire (for specials/and or alt weapon)
     
     Image in my head is of person with Sword and hand-cannon, click to move, click to attack with sword
     Q to acquire cannon target, E to fire powerful AoE shot
     
     Controller compatible is:
           D-pad move
           A primary attack, B secondary attack, x?  y? r? l? rb? lb? 
      
      If we approach with controller compatibility as our objective -- 
         we know we have a max of 8 forms of interaction + movement with optional duplicated movement 
         or D-pad as further 4 further options and joystick as single movement option
      this gives us a hard cap (good) on structuring interactivity. 
      Note: The witcher 2 is an excellent example of too many abilities/interactions on a keyboard. 
             Ideally, we shouldn't use more than can be mapped to Mouse+WASD and -maybe- 1-5
           
     
     Great thought when thinking about how close my ideal aligns with the Rogue-like genre...
         perhaps align the concept with my older ToV or AoD concepts which have a great narrative growth structure
         which would be foreign to most gamers. Note to self: "I am the Word"

Clever...   we can use a separate color to implement a physics collidable layer..   we can use physics.net to convert the physics bitmap into polygon colliders for custom stuff like "walls kill you" or "bouncy walls" etc..
